# Version 1.1

Took Sudo privileges away from Pokemon and made the roots-pokemon.txt owner "ash" so users will have an idea for future ssh use.

I also changed the text files permissions to now show they are owned by either pokemon or ash, so they don't all have the generic root.

I also fixed the official writeup to represent these changes.

Added a JavaScript array when inspecting the webpage. It now displays 10 random pokemon in the console.
